//write something to notes in the console and into a txt file


9/20 next steps

1) RegEX class and start coding everything in and reference it back in the main
    
2) find tweets that have more references in them

3) Build the hash map class 

4) Sort the hash map class topologically and send the results to an output file and to the console


Important things 2 note: 
-We want to make the program general enough so that we can point to a directory and have all of the files from the directory parsed through
-We want to have different functions in the REGEX class that denote different things
-We need to explain what we have coded both in our comments as well as in the READ me - so that it is easier to read
-we might need to make a function for reg ex in our main and then multiple classes just for regex
